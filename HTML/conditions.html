             <h4>3.FROZEN SHOULDER:</h4> 
             When a person has frozen shoulder, the shoulder joint stiffens and hurts, making it difficult to move the arm. 
             Injury, surgery, or other medical issues may be the root of it. Exercises that increase heart rate are not advised 
             for those with frozen shoulder since they may endanger the joint even more. Instead, it is advised to perform 
             strengthening and stretching activities to increase range of motion and lessen pain.

   <h4> 4.CERVICAL RADIOCULOPATHY:</h4> 
   <img class="images1" src="../images/CERVICAL.jpeg" alt="">
   <h4>Exercises for cervical radiculopathy</h4>:
   <ul>
   <li><h6>Pinched Nerve Exercises:</h6>
     Most people with cervical radiculopathy work with an orthopedic physical therapist or one who is a musculoskeletal specialist. Your physical therapist may use various treatments to manage your cervical radiculopathy.
     Exercise and postural correction should be your main tools in the treatment of your cervical radiculopathy. The goals of rehab for a pinched nerve are to restore normal neck motion, improve strength and posture, and give you a self-care strategy to keep pressure off the nerve.
     Before starting any exercise program for cervical radiculopathy, check in with your healthcare provider to ensure that it is safe for you to proceed.
     If you have pain in your arm, monitor your symptoms as you exercise. If symptoms of pain and numbness or tingling get worse in your arm as you exercise, stop. This is a sign that the nerve is getting compressed more.
     If arm pain decreases and shoulder blade or neck pain increase as you exercise, keep going. This is a phenomenon called centralization, and the centralization of pain that occurs as you exercise is a good sign.
     When exercising, keep an eye on your symptoms if you have arm ache. Stop exercising if your arm's pain, numbness, or tingling sensations worsen. This indicates that the nerve is being increasingly squeezed.
     Continue exercising if arm discomfort lessens but shoulder blade or neck pain intensifies. The centralization of pain during activity is a positive indication of this process, which is known as centralization.
   </li>

   <li><h6>chin Tuck:</h5>
     Upper cervical flexion and lower cervical extension are brought about by the exercise known as cervical retraction, or the chin tuck. The nerves in your neck may feel less stressed as a result.
     ake a hard-backed chair and sit up straight to execute cervical retraction. Imagine that your head is on a shelf, then slowly pull it back to straighten your upper neck. As your neck reclines, you should slightly tuck your chin. Your head should move straight back, and you should be sure to keep your eyes level.
     Hold the position with your neck fully pushed back for three seconds, and then gradually let go of it. Ten times each, three to four times per day, perform the neck retraction exercise.
   </li> 

   <li><h6>Traction Training:</h6>
     In hospitals and other healthcare facilities, cervical traction is a popular treatment used for cervical radiculopathy. According to research, performing traction workouts at home also has advantages.
     <br>
     One can:
     Your feet should be positioned in the middle while you recline on the bed's edge.
     Your head should hang freely from the bed as you lower your upper body.
     Maintain the posture for one minute.
     Try this exercise 6 times a day. The study showed that after 3 weeks, it relieved pain and related symptoms.
    </li>

   <li><h6>Neural Flossing:</h6>
     Neural flossing, also known as neural gliding, is a method for easing tight and tense nerves. The treatment of cervical radiculopathy frequently involves it.4
     <br>
     These neck exercises (forward, backward) are designed to stretch the problematic area to the point of tingling, with some persons experiencing brief slight pain. They are made to increase range of motion, flexibility, and balance.
    </li>

   <li><h6>Neck Extension:</h6>
      Forward head posture issues, a prevalent condition linked to work stations and your ergonomic surroundings, can be treated with exercises to increase neck extension and range of motion. According to studies, purchasing a new workstation might not be as important as exercising.
     <br>
      The National Academy of Sports Medicine advises stretching the neck while holding an outstretched arm to lengthen the neck and thoracic muscles. up to four times each day while maintaining the posture for 20 to 30 seconds. Combining this practice with others, such as self-myofascial release, can be beneficial.</li> 
    
    <li><h6>Side Tilts:</h6>
      A wonderful exercise for cervical radiculopathy brought on either stenosis or arthritis is the neck tilt. As you sit in a chair and progressively tilt your neck to one side, moving your ear closer your shoulder, you will be performing this exercise./li>
    
    <li><h6>Hash Isometric:</h6>
      Isometric holds, a sort of exercise where you hold the motion in your neck muscles stationary, may also be a part of the treatment for cervical radiculopathy. They operate on the principle of resistance; for instance, you might hold your neck tilted for 30 seconds while pressing your hand against it, then release the position. You can carry it out either standing or seated.
      Isometric holds are a wonderful option if you've had surgery or need to recuperate from an injury because they focus on a specific area. To see if isometric holds for your shoulders and arms can help with the issue, ask your physical therapist.
      Return to the upright, neutral position after three seconds of holding the position. Ten times in total. To ease a pinched neck nerve, you can repeat the side neck tilt for the opposite side, or your therapist can ask you to just bend in one way. You can also be instructed to cran your neck forward as much as possible.</li>
    
    <li><h6>Shoulder Circles:</h6>
      Shoulder circles can ease tension in your upper and lower neck muscles and may increase your awareness of your posture. Sit erect in a chair and slowly raise your shoulders up toward your ears to execute the exercise. After that, roll your shoulders back while pinching your shoulder blades.
      <br>
       Unwind before performing the workout 10 times. This exercise can be performed multiple times daily to ease tension in the muscles and raise awareness of one's posture.</li>
    
    <li><h6>side-to-side reinforcer:</h6>
      Your therapist might suggest this cervical rotation exercise to increase general neck mobility. Sit erect in a chair and turn your head as far to one side as you can to complete the exercise. When you have reached the limit of the range, hold the position for a short while before bringing your head back to neutral. Ten times to one side, and then ten times to the other, repeat the exercise.</li>

    </ul>
